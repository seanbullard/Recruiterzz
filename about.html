      <h4><b>Sean Bullard</b></h4>
      <p>Athlete - CEO</p>
      <p>Hi I’m Sean Bullard the CEO  at Recruitzz, I am a 17 year old black athlete. I attend Bishop O'Dowd HighSchool and am currently entering my senior year. have you ever felt that you have what it takes to reach the next level of sports? As a senior pl;aying football I’ve noticed that it is difficult to receive exposure to colleges outside of the country. In 2019 there were one million highschool football players in the country and only 6.5% (71,000) reached the next level (college). Recruitzz is successfully providing athletes with a free, reliable platform where they can build their college profiles and directly, personally interact with college coaches.
